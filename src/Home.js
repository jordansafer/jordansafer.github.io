          <h1>Jordan Safer</h1>
          <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Computational Associate in the 
                Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB) Group within 
                the Center for the Development of Therapeutics (CDoT) 
                at the <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard</a>. 
                My research goals break into three questions: <strong>What</strong>, <strong>Why</strong>, 
                and <strong>How</strong>. The science is in the “What” and the “How”.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>A quick TLDR:</strong> My current focus is on using a building <strong>computational tools</strong> to study 
                the influence of <strong>protein sequence</strong>, <strong>protein structure</strong>, and <strong>genetic variants</strong> to 
                understand and predict <strong>protein behaviors</strong> including <strong>disease mechanisms</strong>, <strong>therapeutic 
                targets</strong>, and <strong>PPI kinetics</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>What:</strong> Research computational techniques to <em>systematically</em> reduce the rate of disease. 
                Work towards giving more people the choice to keep living.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Why:</strong> Many of us have lost someone close to heart too soon, and there’s an inevitability to it. Sometimes, 
                things go wrong. One approach to this is to pick a specific disease, disorder, virus, etc and work 
                to understand it and treat it. And many wonderful researchers are taking the fight to cancers, 
                developmental disorders, and so many other conditions this way. Which brings us to an alternative 
                approach. There are thousands of diseases, and as we age the rate of disease grows at an exponential 
                rate <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22975005/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Niccoli & Partridge, 2012]</a>. 
                With all the technology we have available, I want to speed up the systems we use, and build newer and 
                better ones for understanding and treating diseases. And ultimately, I want to bring this work to the 
                mechanisms of aging that drive the high rates of disease as we age.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>How:</strong> As a computational researcher with a computational background, I see 2 high level challenges to modeling 
                our bodies and everything inside them. Neuroscience aside.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                High fidelity simulation and modeling of individual cells, to the point where we can predict inputs and 
                outputs and behaviors for cell types across our bodies.
                </li>
                <li>
                System level simulation and modeling of multi cellular systems, ranging from tissues to organs to full 
                organisms.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Towards the first objective, my focus is on learning everything about cellular modeling, from the ground 
                up. I’m currently working at the intersection of <strong>genomics</strong> and <strong>protein structure</strong>, 
                with an emphasis on <strong>computational tools</strong> for predicting protein activity both broadly and in 
                the context of disease.
            </p>
            <p>
                That second object - <em>for now</em> - is there to keep in mind.
